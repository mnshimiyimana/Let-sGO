# Let'sGo system

## Introduction

The transportation system project encompasses the development of software and infrastructure improvements. It will involve introducing innovative technology, optimizing bus routes, and incorporating features such as efficient ticketing and improved user experience.I used NodeJs ,React and MongoDB to put this together

## How to run this 

1) Running the user's platform (Web) 
	
	- go inside "web" folder
	
	- run "npm install" using cmd
	
	- then execute the command, "npm run start"

	- Then you are ready to use the web application. (localhost:3000)

2) Running admin panel (admin)
	
	- go inside "admin" folder
	
	- run "npm install" using cmd
	
	- then execute the command, "npm run start"
	
	- Then you are ready to use the admin panel. (localhost:3002)
	
3) Running the back-end (services)
	
	- go inside services folder
	
	- run "npm install" using cmd
	
	- then execute the command, "npm run start"
	
	- then the back-end services will be started in port 3001

P.S: For everything to run make sure the backend is running first
