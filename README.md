## Introduction

The transportation system project encompasses the development of software and infrastructure improvements. It will involve introducing innovative technology, optimizing bus routes, and incorporating features such as efficient ticketing and improved user experience.I used NodeJs ,React and MongoDB to put this together

## How to run this 

1) Running the user's platform (Web) 
	
	- go inside "web" folder

	- once the node modules are installed, ensure the configurations in "src/config.json" file is valid.
	
	- then execute the command, "npm run start"

1) Running the back-end (services)
	
	- go inside services folder
	
	- run "npm install" using cmd
	
	- after installing node modules, edit the "config.json" file if your configurations are different. 
	  
	  (eg: if you have the database in seperate server, change the database config in the config.json file) more details available in the report.
